Co-op and internship opportunities are available to this group as well. Due to the fact that freshman and sophomore students do not have sufficient background, they are often left behind and are not involved in research activities. This paper shares some experiences with a program that was put in place through an NSF STEP grant that provides research opportunities to freshman, sophomore, and first year transfer students. The paper presents examples of projects in which computer science scholars were involved. We have learned that lower-division computer science students are excited about the opportunity to participate in research. Early participation in research helps build a strong community among the freshman and sophomore students, keeps these students engaged, and results in a higher retention rate.},

abstract = {While the needs and applications for computing technology have been growing, the enrollment and interest in Computer Science (CS) at the university level has not been growing in proportion. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of globalization requires a new set of skills for future technology leaders. These skills include the ability to work well in multidisciplinary and globally distributed teams, cross cultural boundaries with ease, create innovative solutions for problems that arise in unfamiliar settings, and think outside the box to solve a variety of problems while building effectively upon related work in the literature. These changes are also reflected in the growing interest among youth in global issues and how we can make a difference in underserved communities. This paper reports on our experience in designing and deploying an innovative internship that addresses these issues and seeks to enhance participation and education in CS through guided research projects in underserved communities.},

On the one hand we offer the students a lot of structure and support; on the other hand an important feature of the course is that they are in control of their own research. A key aspect of the pedagogical approach is that the students are supervised in small teams by experienced staff. The results of evaluations show that the students are positive about the course. One of the main findings is that they feel well prepared to conduct research in the graduate program.},

abstract = {The modern computing landscape increasingly requires a range of skills to successfully integrate complex systems. Project-based learning is used to help students build professional skills. However, it is typically applied to small teams and small efforts. In this paper, we describe our experience in engaging a large number of students in research projects within a multi-year interdisciplinary research effort. The projects expose the students to various disciplines in Electrical Engineering (circuit design, wireless communications, hardware prototyping), Computer Science (embedded systems, algorithm design, networking) and Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication). While a student project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires interaction with at least two other areas. Over 4 years, 115 semester-long projects have been completed. The students were a diverse group of high school, undergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering students. Some of the approaches we have taken to facilitate student learning are real-world system development constraints, regular cross-group meetings, and extensive involvement of Ph.D. students in student mentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess our approaches, we conducted a survey among the participating students. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. For example, 70\% of the students surveyed indicated that working on their research project improved their ability to function on multidisciplinary teams more than coursework, internships, or any other activity.},

Unfortunately, in computing fields, only a small fraction of the professorate is women and/or members of minority racial groups. To address this issue, the current research assessed the role of research experiences for undergraduate students (REUs) on underrepresented students' interest in pursuing a career as a computing professor. We found that REUs utilizing a set of specific practices are linked with underrepresented students' interest in becoming a computing professor. On the other hand, no specific REU practice was associated with majority students' (i.e., White and Asian men's) level of interest in becoming a professor. Thus, this research not only identifies aspects of REUs that may be especially important for increasing diversity in the professorate but also highlights that REUs may serve different purposes for underrepresented versus majority students.},

abstract = {Research experiences for undergraduates (REUs) have many positive outcomes on students' perception of and retention in Computer Science (CS). Yet nearly all REUs are aimed at late-college students, well into a CS program. We present the Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP), a 4 quarter program designed to engage early-college (first or second year) CS students in high-quality research experiences in active research groups at a large research university. ERSP's structured course-supported group-apprentice model and its unique dual advising structure make it possible to vastly increase number of early-career CS students who participate in high-quality research experiences with little additional burden on individual faculty mentors. ERSP's focus on community building and support makes it particularly appropriate for students from groups who are traditionally underrepresented in CS. This paper reports the structure of the program and observations and learning thus-far with ERSP, with the goal of enabling others to implement this program at other large research-focused universities.},

abstract = {Underrepresented students in computing (women and non-White/non-Asian men) are known to feel a weaker sense of belonging than majority students (Asian/White men). This difference is important because a low sense of belonging can lead to disengagement and attrition in education settings. In the current study, we assessed whether and how early formal research experience might narrow this gap in sense of belonging. The sample for this study derives from a longitudinal study on undergraduate students affiliated with computing departments across the United States. We used propensity scores to generate an appropriate sub-sample of students to compare against formal research participants (n = 110 formal research students; n = 110 students with no formal research experience). We found formal research experience during students/ first year was associated with a strong sense of mentor support during their second year. Perceived mentor support predicted a strong sense of belonging for underrepresented students, but not majority students. Importantly, the typical gap in sense of belonging among underrepresented and majority students disappeared among students with high mentor support. Our work suggests that formal research, when introduced early, might promote greater diversity in computing in the long term. We present a model for early undergraduate research, and resources for readers who wish to adopt the model.},

The overarching research questions are: what attitudinal shifts occur for undergraduate research experience student participants, and do experience perceptions differ based upon student demographics? Results across two cohort years showed statistically significant gains for several key program level outcomes. However, intent to go to graduate school decreased in both cohorts. Gender and ethnicity differences were observed. Women and underrepresented minority group students had significantly higher scores for several factors. These findings are discussed in context of culturally relevant pedagogy for undergraduate research programs. This study is unique in its scale and scope, providing a depiction of student outcomes across multiple cohorts of a national sample including over 58 computing research sites and more than 900 undergraduate students.},

abstract = {The DIVAS (Digital Imaging and Vision Applications in Science) project addresses workforce challenges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by creating a pedagogical and programmatic "on-ramp" that empowers natural science majors to engage in authentic computational problems as members of skilled, professional teams. We are developing and testing institutional practices and curricular innovations that engage and train STEM undergraduate students to use Python programming, and image processing in particular, in their undergraduate research projects. Students are recruited into the DIVAS program in the first semester of their first year. DIVAS scholars and other participating students can experience a variety of interventions including: 1) a one-credit DIVAS seminar exploring several imaging and computing topics; 2) image capture and analysis modules in introductory- or upper-level biology and chemistry courses; 3) a week-long, intensive coding bootcamp that introduces bash, git, Python programming, and the OpenCV image processing library; 4) pair programming exercises to solve genuine morphometric and colorimetric problems; 5) an extended summer research project involving image processing; and 6) weekly code reviews to check on progress and provide guidance. The DIVAS projects measures the impact of these interventions on students' self-reported efficacy in using computation to solve problems, their attitudes towards computation, and their computational thinking skills, using both established and newly developed instruments. Our first year results show that multiple interventions have had significant positive impact on students' self-efficacy and interest in using computing in their future careers, and certain computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {Involving students in research activities has been credited with many benefits, such as increased critical thinking and analysis skills, development of self-confidence and intellectual independence, and consolidating the ability to ``think like a scientist.'' Student research experiences at undergraduate level have been extensively investigated and disseminated. At postgraduate level, however, research is very scant and experience reports on practices used are scarce. This paper discusses an approach to provide an authentic research experience to master's level students in Advanced Software Engineering. We present the learning, teaching, and assessment methods, as well as, important parameters for success, such as techniques for creating a motivational and intellectual research climate and methods for maximizing the quality of results. We also demonstrate how through a research experience, students can not only advance their research skills, but also strengthen their employability profile. The paper includes an evaluation from six cohorts with the results indicating that students consider the experience very valuable. In 2014, our approach has been accredited by the British Computer Society (BCS) as an example of best practice for innovative approaches to assessment and how they enhance the student experience.},

Each summer, ten REU students participated in: an annual two-day team-building orientation; a four day long ramp-up session to learn about REU projects and the skill sets they would need to master; weekly meetings with graduate and faculty mentors to define objectives, deliverables, and progress; and weekly skill development workshops to learn how to conduct research, prepare for future endeavors, and present oneself in professional settings. A total of seven faculty and twelve graduate students participated in ARG model process meetings to ensure students received comparable experiences and facilitated professional development activities. We provide an overview of our REU ARG model experience and reflect on improvements based on faculty mentor, graduate mentor, and undergraduate researchers' experiences.},

abstract = {Undergraduate research experiences have been shown to have many positive effects on undergraduates including increased confidence, sense of belonging and retention. However, many previous studies of undergraduate research experiences have focused on advanced undergraduate (juniors and seniors) in one-on-one research experiences with a faculty mentor. Less is known about the effects of early undergraduate research, particularly via opportunities that scale beyond one-on-one faculty-student relationships to encompass large numbers of early undergraduates. The research question addressed in this work is whether a more scalable group-based research model aimed at early undergraduates from groups underrepresented in computing would show the same kinds of benefits for participants as more personalized one-on-one programs aimed at more advanced students. We evaluated a group-based early research program in the computer science department of a large public university. Through survey data and direct measurements of performance and retention several years after students had completed the program, we found that students who participated in this program have higher overall GPAs, more confidence, and more interest in research compared to several different control groups. Our design also allowed us to examine the considerable impact that selection bias can have on the evaluation of research programs. This work both validates the scalable structure of this research program and provides a richer perspective on the benefits of early undergraduate research in CS.},

abstract = {Despite the documented importance of mentoring in undergraduate research, few studies examine how students---especially early undergraduates in computing---perceive their relationships with their mentors. We present a qualitative thematic analysis of the mentoring practices used in an inclusive, structured computer science research program targeting second-year undergraduates across two large public research universities in the United States. Uniquely in this program, students had two mentoring sources: a technical mentor for each research group and a graduate student mentor common to all groups. We analyzed reflections on mentoring from 64 undergraduate researchers at two points in the program. We compared the roles of the two mentors, characterized students' perceptions of both successful and unsuccessful mentors, and examined how mentoring relationships evolved. Generally, students valued mentors who provided project guidance or technical support and who were perceived to be friendly. We found that the roles of the two mentors were complementary in sometimes surprising ways. Overall, our analysis confirms prior work on undergraduate research mentoring, and provides new insights into the unique benefits of a dual-mentoring approach and how to best support early undergraduate computing researchers.},

abstract = {In this experience report, we describe the rationale and need for immersive research experiences (IREs) in computer science (CS) that are designed to foster an inclusive community that encourages pursuit of graduate education for undergraduate women. Google's exploreCSR supports institutions across the US to execute IREs in computing throughout the academic year. We describe the program design and framework, the evaluation model, and present outcomes from two years of implementation across 29 institutions, with 1,983 (92\% female) student participants collectively. The unique features of the program are that it aligns goals, measurements, and best practices across a national network of hands-on, localized IREs, resulting in peer communities and a sizable sample of undergraduates who identify as women and/or African-American/Black, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American, Hispanic/Latinx, and/or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AAHN). We discuss recommendations for effective IRE programming based on our evaluation and the features found to be particularly salient for AAHN women. The contribution of this work is in describing how a national initiative for IREs builds community and creates conditions known to support persistence of women in computer science.},

abstract = {Currently, the computer science community is experiencing a rise in interest in computer science education research (CSER). However, current structures and belief systems within the discipline have largely relegated computer science education researchers to the margins. Computer science education researchers are mainly 'lone-wolf' scholars in their departments that participate in CSER in addition to their more widely 'accepted' computer science research. As such, there has been a resistance to offer doctoral programs in CSER. Florida International University has not only invested inCSER by hiring a CSER tenure-track faculty member, they have also established a School of Computer Science Education and Engineering Education. Despite this investment, one obstacle remains the low visibility and understanding of computer science education research among undergraduate students. This makes establishing are search group of Ph.D. students challenging. In order to combat this obstacle, a four-year program was developed as a dedicated pipeline to the computer science education Ph.D. through a series of research experiences for undergraduates (REU). Summer 2020 consisted of the first cohort of this four year commitment. Given that 2020 was wrought with a series of unprecedented events, this REU was designed and executed virtually. This paper presents the plan, setting, execution, and subsequent evaluation of this virtual REU experience. Student-feedback was overwhelmingly positive; however, as with any endeavor there were many lessons learned.},

abstract = {We provide an experience report about a remote framework for early undergraduate research experiences, which was thematically focused on sensing humans computationally. The framework included three complementary components. First, students experienced a team-based research cycle online, spanning formulating research questions, conducting literature review, performing fully remote human subject data collection experiments and data processing, analyzing and making inference over acquired data with computational experimentation, and disseminating findings. Second, the virtual program offered a set of professional development activities targeted to developing skills and knowledge for graduate school and research career trajectories. Third, it offered interactional and cohort-networking programming for community-building. We discuss not only the unique challenges of the virtual format and the steps put in place to address them but also the opportunities that being online afforded to innovate undergraduate research training remotely. We evaluate the remote training intervention through the organizing team's post-program reflection and the students' perceptions conveyed in exit interviews and a mid-program focus group. In addition to outlining lessons learned about more or less successful framework elements, we offer recommendations for applying the framework at other institutions as well as how to transfer activities to in-person formats.},

abstract = {While the computer science community has explored the importance of Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs) and, separately, collaboration in computing (e.g. pair programming), little research has studied collaboration in the context of a URE. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis of how students collaborate within a group-structured, academic-year, inclusive computing URE catered towards second-year students at two large public research universities in the United States. We analyzed free-response and Likert-scale survey data collected early and late in the program from a total of 106 students who comprised three program cohorts. We studied their overall group function, what aspects of group work led to positive or negative group experiences, how their group affected their feelings of being supported, and how their group affected their sense of belonging in computing. We found that group experiences were overwhelmingly positive. Further, we found that students’ experiences in groups centered around three themes: group fit and belonging, emotional and academic support, and logistics. Within each theme, their experiences were rich and nuanced, and we observed variations by gender, and to a lesser degree by race. Our work suggests that group-structured UREs are both feasible and beneficial for students, and we give concrete suggestions for how to make these experiences successful.},

abstract = {In nationwide efforts to promote computing education, undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have been identified as an effective way to not only motivate research and graduate studies, but to also increase participation and retention, promote disciplinary knowledge and diversity in the field, develop strong soft and technical skills, and integrate students in the community. Yet, despite these many benefits, opportunities for UREs are still limited. And even though the challenge of finding faculty mentors is one of the major barriers, there is still limited research exploring the faculty perspective in greater depth. In this paper, we leveraged an onboarding process for a new program to interview twelve engineering faculty doing computing-related research in a large public research institution about their experiences and perspectives towards UREs. These faculty members ranged in experience from working regularly with many undergraduates to having limited or no prior experience. Our analysis uncovered four main themes on barriers to UREs around the central concept of misalignment: misalignments between the educational system and research, misalignments between faculty and student goals, misalignments between expectations of research and reality, and the challenge of getting to and maintaining steady state when trying to create alignment. We conclude by discussing design implications for designing programs and computational ecosystems that scale access to UREs by helping to overcome misalignments.},

abstract = {Despite the expansion and development of the field of computing education (CEd), a lack of formal programs means that researchers often exist as islands across and within a diverse range of departments. Given the broad nature of the discipline, trying to build a community typically occurs through more formal conferences. Another way to expand engagement with the field is through Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), programs that offer students the chance to get involved with research. REUs have been shown to strengthen disciplinary identity and encourage the pursuit of graduate degrees. However, such opportunities are not usually available at the graduate level. To address this gap, we present an experience report that describes our approach, Research Experiences for Graduate Students (REGS). In the work that follows, we detail our implementation and the partnerships created that allowed (n = 10) internationally dispersed graduate students from different institutions the chance to build connections, conduct CEd research, and develop a graduate-centric community. Leadership researchers, faculty, and staff supported the efforts, offering guidance and critical examination of the work to establish rigor over the course of the projects. Publications and presentations contributed to the CEd knowledge base, and interviews with the students upon completion of the experience illustrated the value of participation in the REGS.},

We found that the retention rate of program participants was higher than the control at both universities, though not statistically significantly so. We found no significant difference in post-program GPA, and the program did not erase equity gaps in GPA by race and first generation status that existed before the program. These results help us understand the benefits and limitations of large-scale early research programs for increasing equity in computer science.},
